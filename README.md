# -Lukoil-basic-interface

<H2>Purpose</H2>

This project aims to explore basic analysis of "Lukoil" and provide basic interface to it.

<H2>Tools Used</H2>

The following tools and technologies were utilized in the development of this project:

* Python: The primary programming language used for the logic and functionality.

* PyQt: A Python library used for designing and implementing the graphical user interface (GUI).
